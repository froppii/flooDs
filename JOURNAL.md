**20 May - Looked up things I needed and how I am going to do this**

This day was spent looking up things I needed to make the #highway-pitstop post! I also looked into the prices and overall the specs/capabilities and features of the 3DS and 3DS XL

**27 May - Pretty much completed the parts list... i think?** 
Aside from working on the [protogen](https://github.com/froppii/proto) head, I researched a bit more on what i needed.. specifically when it comes to the battery. I wanted the batteries to be easily changed just like in the original 3DS, and decided that a lipo battery would be the closest thing i can get. I also found out how hard a 3a 3.7v to 5v boost converter module is to find, most of them are either 1a or 2a.
